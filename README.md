🧑‍🏫 Mid-to-senior machine learning & software engineer, contractor, and freelancer

🧠 Dedicated to building great products that will have an impact on the world. I am a curiosity-driven person. Passionate about topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning. But, I am open to learn about any topic related to data. Also, I enjoy writing software. Experienced in backend and mobile applications. Data is the new oil and I want to help to build the infrastructure for it.

🎮 In my free time, I like to cook and read about the human mind, blockchain, and new technologies as investment opportunities.

💬 Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating.
